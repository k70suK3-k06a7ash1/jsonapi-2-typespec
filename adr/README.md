# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the jsonapi-2-typespec project. ADRs document significant architectural decisions, their context, consequences, and rationale.

## ADR Template

For new ADRs, use the following structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status:** [Proposed|Accepted|Deprecated|Superseded]

## Contributing

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Create a new ADR using the next sequential number
2. Follow the template structure
3. Update this index
4. Reference related ADRs
5. Include implementation details and consequences
